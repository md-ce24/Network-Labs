# 📘 Network-Labs

This repository contains **networking case studies** documenting real-world lab scenarios.  
Each case study is structured as: **Problem → Solution → Implementation → Results → Diagrams/Configs**.  

The goal is to present networking knowledge in a **practical, case-study format** to showcase problem-solving and technical skills.

## 📂 Case Studies

1. [Case Study 1: Subnetting & IP Addressing](./CaseStudy-1-Subnetting/README.md)  
   - Designing efficient subnets using VLSM.  

2. [Case Study 2: VLANs & Router-on-a-Stick](./CaseStudy-2-VLAN-RouterOnStick/README.md)  
   - Segmenting a network into VLANs and enabling inter-VLAN routing.  

3. [Case Study 3: DHCP Server Implementation](./CaseStudy-3-DHCP/README.md)  
   - Automating IP assignments with DHCP on a router.
